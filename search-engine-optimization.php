                SEO is like gardening and every business is like a plant. Different plants require different types of care to grow and flourish. All of us are aware of the basics of gardening, you take soil, plant the seed, water it, give it sunlight, pick the weeds and watch it grow. But what kind of soil? How much water? How much sunlight? Should we transfer the seed to a larger pot in time, or should we give it room to grow from the start? This is exactly how it is with search engine optimization. We all know the basics – things like website development, content creation,  the need for marketing etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, details like what kind of content you should put on your website? How often do you need to engage on social media platforms? When and how to expand your target audience? are questions that require extensive market research and analysis.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is where we come in, our experts help you answer all of these questions and when your business starts to take off, just like a seasoned gardener, they will make sure that your business keeps on getting the essential nutrients needed for growth.

                    Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a process that involves making changes in your website so that search engines like Google and Bing can find, read, and understand your content and display it in search results when a user enters their search query for your industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    SEO is how your website is discovered by people on the internet. The primary objective of search engine optimization is enhancing a website’s discoverability by helping it rank at the highest possible spot for a range of user queries or “keywords”.

                    A lot of things go into search engine optimization. In simpler terms, SEO works by making your website attractive to search engines like Google. This means that your website needs to possess all the components that the algorithms of search engines love so that they give you a higher ranking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Making these changes (or optimizations) in your website include things like putting up title tags, writing a meta description, putting up alt tags, reducing the size of images, making your website load faster, etc. These practices make it easier for the search engines to crawl and index your website treating you as a good resource that users should visit, resulting in good rankings.

                    Without search engine optimization practically all internet users won’t know your website exists. Unless your website is easily locatable by search engines like Google, your business will not receive the brand visibility that you are looking for. You can only maximize the benefits of having a website if you rank among the top 10 results on the first page of search engines. A good SEO company can help you gain traction and make your way into the top rank.

                    The time taken for your website’s rankings to start improving generally depends upon a variety of its KPIs prior to performing SEO. As a rule of thumb, all the websites that have high authority backlink portfolios, garner more trust from search engines, hence they end up climbing rankings much faster than an average website.

                  <p>
                    The average website takes anywhere between 8-10 weeks to display some improvement since search engines need time to crawl, evaluate, re-index new content and react to enhanced website performance. But keep in mind, SEO is a service for the long run, you will begin to see more significant progress after 6 months to 1 years time and so forth.

                    At the outset, all search engines work in the same way – you enter a search query and they display various websites that will offer you further information on the topic. But yes, there are some intrinsic differences in how the algorithms and protocols of a particular search engine work. However, it does not deeply affect the search engine optimization strategy as all search engines want to show the most relevant and useful search results to the user. This can be achieved for almost all search engines with similar techniques. Google has the largest market share, so optimizing your website for Google is the best way to move forward.

                    With some learning, trial and error, yes you can implement a basic SEO strategy on your own. Performing SEO activities on your own more often than not conclude in not seeing your desired results. Incomplete knowledge can affect SEO badly. Google Webmaster i.e. GSC can categorize your website in manual action (meaning, your website can be marked as spam) the outcome will be additional efforts to right the wrongs. First they will have to neutralize the mistakes and then start over from scratch. Not to mention, the tools required for analysis and reports can be quite a hefty investment.

                    Generally, not. When needed, there may be subtle editing to your website's content that is seamlessly integrated and matches your brand's style and voice. In certain cases, additional web pages may be added or the page or site structure may be improved upon or recommendations may be made for the usage of more usable and efficient navigation. Whichever path is best for your website's success in search engine rankings, its implications on the usability of your website and your brand image, should be given equal priority.
