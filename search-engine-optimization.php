                SEO is like gardening and every business is like a plant. Different plants require different types of care to grow and flourish. All of us are aware of the basics of gardening, you take soil, plant the seed, water it, give it sunlight, pick the weeds and watch it grow. But what kind of soil? How much water? How much sunlight? Should we transfer the seed to a larger pot in time, or should we give it room to grow from the start? This is exactly how it is with search engine optimization. We all know the basics – things like website development, content creation,  the need for marketing etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, details like what kind of content you should put on your website? How often do you need to engage on social media platforms? When and how to expand your target audience? are questions that require extensive market research and analysis.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is where we come in, our experts help you answer all of these questions and when your business starts to take off, just like a seasoned gardener, they will make sure that your business keeps on getting the essential nutrients needed for growth.
