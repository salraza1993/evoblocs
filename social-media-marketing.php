                    Hiring social media marketing services is beneficial in two ways. To begin with, you do not need to hire an in-house team and secondly, you do not have to worry about social channels. Most businesses think that social media marketing is easy, all you have to do is post some images and boom, followers will start raining in like anything - But this is not true at all! Social media marketing agencies have dedicated experts for each platform who handle all of the post creation, publishing, engagement, and refine these processes by monitoring analytics continuously.

                    There is no right way to market on social media. But here’s something that you should always keep in mind – use social media to connect with your audience! People want clear and benefit oriented content, they want content that addresses their real needs, problems and questions, they want to be introduced to the man behind the mask and see who you are, they want content that is easy to consume and digest and they want to witness your efforts and become part of your journey through interaction. Social media marketing is built to fill these gaps while establishing thought leadership in your industry. By leveraging various social media channels where your audience is present and sharing relevant content, you can gain their attention more easily. The right social media marketing strategy will generate organic leads, build an online community and turn your customers into loyal brand advocates.

                    It is no secret that the world has gone social! In fact, 30% of all time spent online is allocated to social media. What makes it so relevant today, is the fact that it is highly accessible and also considerably cheaper than traditional marketing channels. If you want your business to be in front of many people, social media is the way to do it. Whether you are looking for brand awareness, sponsored content or both, social media marketing is a viable platform.

                    It is quite easy to get caught up in the hype regarding new social media platforms but the fact remains that every social media channel you adopt, requires time, energy and budget in order to effectively meet your market goals. An important thing that you should keep in mind is your target audience, for example, if you are a B2C business, you should use a social media channel where you can interact with your customers directly, similarly if you are a B2B business, you should use a channel where you can connect with other businesses. If you are talking about a starting point, then choose one or two platforms that make the most sense for your business and capitalise on them by making frequent, high-quality posts or save yourself the efforts and hire a team of experts!

                    This depends on your business goals, for instance are you trying to build brand awareness or targeting a sales strategy for a product release or service. The frequency of posts varies on different social media platforms because different media channels have their own best practices. On average, we post 1 to 2 posts per day, for optimum user engagement and lead generation.

                  <p>
                    The basic difference between an ad and a post on social media is that a post is content shared on your account that your followers will see organically, while an ad is a paid post that is used to target an audience outside of your followers list, on the basis of demographics and interests. The biggest reason why ads work today is because social media algorithms now limit the number of followers who can see the content you share organically, for this reason promoting your products and services through relevant posts, guarantees a wider reach.

                    Every platform has its own term for ads that are posted, irrespective of the term used, they all fulfill the same purpose which is increasing reach and engagement through the social media advertising platform. Boosted or sponsored posts, generally enable analytics, so that you can monitor the engagement and widen the net for the target audience.

                    There is no fixed amount, rather according to your business goals and relevant analytics reports you can get an understanding of how much money should be invested to reach your aim. There are two aspects to keep in mind for social media marketing - the first - posting content and growing a community organically, which admittedly is a slower process - the second option - spend money promoting posts and running ads to boost conversions which gives faster results. It all boils down to your business's goals, your budget and the given timeline.
