            <h6>Founder and CEO</h6>
            <p>
              Catherine has her base in Economics, a field she has been interested in since the tender age of 13 when she had her first day trading account. Since then, she has found ways to combine her passions with her organizational and entrepreneurial skills to develop clubs and small businesses suitable for creating the lifestyle and environments which she and her fellow community have been desirous of.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Let the systems and tools which we create serve the vision and welfare of the people practically.”
            </p>
            <p>
              After switching gears for 7 years, living in India studying and practicing yoga, philosophy, and language she has returned to the world of entrepreneurship and began EvoBlocs, digital marketing and development firm. Catherine’s approach to EvoBlocs and the culture of the work environment is in creating a space where expertise is paired with balance, communication, and support.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We want to think and see beyond what the client is asking, in order to create the greatest experience for both the provider and the user. And we like to do it in such a way that we feel as if we are working alongside our companions of many years.”
            </p>
            <p>
              When Catherine is not engaged in projects related to EvoBlocs, she can be found reading and/ or translating books from Hindi into English, doing services in the temple where she lives in India, enjoying the sun or perhaps keeping up with the latest crypto news.

I am well acquainted with the step-by-step process to build the overall online reputation of any business. I am expert at optimizing sites from scratch or any that have been blacklisted by Google’s algorithms so that they can gain their rankings back. I have never faced any penalties on our clients’ sites for as long as I have been in this career, as I follow ethical practices and I never build poor links. I look forward to building long term relationships with our clients by putting their needs first and executing the client's vision with full dedication and commitment. As the Director of Digital Marketing for EvoBlocs, I can ensure this is the standard for our entire digital marketing team.” Amit loves his work so it's hard to steal him away but when he is not working you can catch him going for a morning walk, bringing, or picking his daughter up from school or visiting with family.
