          At this stage, to give you an idea about what your final product will look like, we will wireframe for you, an intuitive, visually appealing, interactive prototype. By creating prototypes and mock-ups we determine how users will respond to your mobile application. This validated information is then fed into the branding, usability, functionality and design of your mobile app, bringing your vision to fruition.

        <h3>Backend and Frontend Development</h3>
        <p>
          An app can generally be characterised into two parts, frontend and backend. While the front end is what your app is going to look like, the backend involves all the operations that make the app work, such as databases, scripts, algorithms, etc. Leveraging the data and processes from the backend with the help of APIs, the frontend offers the app users a seamless experience.

        <h3>Q/A Testing</h3>
        <p>
          EvoBlocs tests mobile applications from the moment of conception, all the way to the final release. Our mobile app developers create test scenarios for every function, which are tested thoroughly throughout the development process to ensure that your app performs as expected and does not have any unanticipated bugs or glitches. We also perform integration testing for the backend, wherein pivotal user scenarios running sequences of API requests are simulated. Apart from this, we conduct continuous tests to evaluate metrics regarding code quality, graphic user interface and performance testing for larger projects

        <h3>Deployment</h3>
        <p>
          At this stage, your app will be placed on a live server where the public can for the first time gain user access and begin to interface with databases via account creations and other interactive forms built into your app.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to your business rationale, it may be that deployment and launch happen simultaneously.

          Finally, it's time to submit your app to the relevant app stores. Without further ado, after formally reviewing and testing the app it will be made available for downloads by customers. While the process of submission to app stores is quite simple, some knowledge of app development is required for generating app builds and certificates.

          Our work does not end with the launch. We work with our clients to understand their business objectives and KPIs and factor them into analytics, strategies and data reporting plans. Collecting meaningful data on your app’s performance and user engagement from day one, we leverage it to garner useful insights that lead to informed optimization and drive desired results. Apart from this, we also assist with Google and Apple app store optimisation, that helps in improving the position and visibility of your app.

                    The cost of development depends on a lot of factors – project deliverables, target user-base, the complexity of the mission statement, project timeline, geographical location etc. The best way to determine the cost of a mobile app is to talk to our experts to discuss the needs and solutions.

                    Following agile scrum methodology, we divide the project into 2 week sprints. First together with the client and our team, we prioritize the entire project's tasks into daily and weekly milestones, then the work begins upon which there is a weekly meeting to display the progress to the client. If at any point the client has new ideas or wants to join in they are welcome to take part in our daily meeting where in regards to additions we will assess any necessary changes related to tasks and deadlines. Before we begin the next 2 week sprint we will together thoroughly evaluate our current status.

                    We maintain complete transparency with the client from start to finish. We use continuous integration throughout our mobile app development process, which means that you will always have access to the latest version of the app on your device.

                    The estimated time for mobile app development depends on the complexity of your requirements, the scope of the project, the platform and the size of the team required. The clearer the vision and groundwork (i.e. information regarding database integration, features, etc.) the faster the development but don’t worry, we tackle all these aspects within the first week!
