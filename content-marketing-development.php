            While self-hosting blogs is a standard procedure, a robust content marketing strategy demands a healthy mix of both self-hosted and third-party blogs.

          <p>
            As we all know, blogs help in increasing user activity and website credibility through backlinks. Having said that however, you cannot always rely on organic traffic through backlinks. Building your audience from the ground up can be difficult - this is why publishing third party content is an important SEO strategy for increasing SERP rankings.

            Using our third party blog writing services ensures that information about your products and services gets a wider audience. Since third party blogging offers you a built-in pool of highly engaged readers, your business can leverage popular categories to get your posts in front of the right users.

                    If you produce good content, you can fulfill all the criteria, which will make Google view you as an expert in that category. This perceived expertise is known as ‘domain authority’ and if you have high domain authority, your content is going to be ranked higher than your competition’s, because Google is going to consider you to be a trustworthy source. With high domain authority, you will appear at the top search results, and content marketing is the most reliable way to make that happen.
